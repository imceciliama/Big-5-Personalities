# Big-5-Personalities
The dataset contains information about 250 Facebook users, 15 variables, 9917 records including Facebook statuses in raw texts and network features (network size, betweenness centrality, density, brokerage and transitivity) as independent variables. These 250 users were made to answer 100 item long version of IPIP questioners, this yielded big5 personality values and categories (y/n) as the personality class (gold standard). In the dataset, only the final categorial 
variables in Big5 personality dimensions are included. 
Our task is to use the Facebook statuses and network features to cluster the 250 users and explore the relationship between Big 5 personality and each cluster, i.e., match the cluster results with the Big 5 personality traits.
